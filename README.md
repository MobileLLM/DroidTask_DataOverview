# DroidTask

This repository contains introduction to our open source data. You can download it from 
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SergVsuQQThuhmRl63CtkQ5Vv-Pj68OQ?usp=share_link).

There are 2 files in the Drive; they are similar on size and content: `user_tasks` contains several `.yaml` files as tasks for each app.
- `user_tasks.tar.gz`
- `utgs.tar.gz`

## user_tasks

Inside the `user_tasks`, there are several sub-folders named as each app; inside them there are several task files written in `.yaml`.

```
user_tasks
├── applauncher
│   ├── task1.yaml
│   ├── task2.yaml
│   ├── task3.yaml
│   ├── task4.yaml
│   └── task5.yaml
```

Every task is organized by a list of `records`. Each record contains **UI state**, **current choice**, **possible input**, and **hashed state string**. Below is one record for example.

```yaml
records:
- Choice: 0
  Input: Clock
  State: "<input id=0 >Search</input>\n <button id=1 text='Sort by'></button>\n <button\
    \ id=2 text='Toggle app name visibility'></button>\n <button id=3 text='More options'></button>\n\
    \ <button id=4>Calendar</button>\n <button id=5>Camera</button>\n <button id=6>Clock</button>\n\
    \ <button id=7>go back</button>"
  new_state_str: 3f9adbf098ff69152b801042222f25ddd612674644e5d20b4c3617b4c9e33b3f
  state_str: ca84887fa50fbe8cb13d9c9fbcd7f1e568612b5e7448bbc9ac0425944993c94c
```

To understand this, the `record` does a step that "Click on the Search button, and input 'Clock' into it". What's more, if there is no input, the `input` will be set to `null`.

> The `state_str` was deprecated. You just need to use the new one to match the states.

## utgs

Besides the task files, we also provide all the raw files generated by `DroidBot-GPT`.

```
utgs
├── applauncher
│   ├── events
│   ├── states
│   ├── states_view_ids
│   ├── stylesheets
│   ├── views
│   └── utg.yaml
```

You should pay attention to the `states` folder, which contains all the states for the `task.yaml` and `utg.yaml`. 

You can find a descriptive `.json` file and corresponding screenshot `.png` file for further usage.
